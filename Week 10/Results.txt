---Trial Results---

For this project I tested the 3 python files to train, use, and find precision with the 
model. The most notable result was the change in time when altering the epoch value, which 
was faster at less passes and slower as the passes increased. I found the batch size to 
have minimal impact on the runtime and prediciton accuracy but this may have been a fluke 
as I only ran three trials. I had trouble producing the "bird_model.h5" file at times and 
I'm still not sure why but it may have hindered my results. Overall I found this project 
to be very insightful regarding deep machine learning and it allowed me to see how these 
programs work, which I feel is very applicable in the job field today as we discussed in 
class.
